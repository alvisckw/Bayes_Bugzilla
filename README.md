This is the GitHub repository for my contribution to the Bugzilla project.

It is the **Final Course Project** of SMM695 Data Management Systems module for 2022/23 MSc Business Analytics at Bayes Business School.

## Project Aim
- To explore and structure the Bugzilla data (which can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/7c4ac3427cb15227/Em8FwrLLycNLu0LF04LuYvIBdI2AfUPFdWXHsatg063LuQ?e=qoo3t8))
- To provide valuable descriptive insights of the data
- To perform insightful data analysis

## Code Explanation
- Imported Bugzilla .pickle data into MongoDB
- Explored the data structure of "cf_status_" and "cf_tracking_" fields
- Re-structured the fields
